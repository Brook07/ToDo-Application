This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Todo Application

This project is a **Todo Application** built using **React.js**, allowing users to manage tasks such as adding, editing, completing, and deleting. The app also maintains the task data across page refreshes using **localStorage**.

---

## üß† Features

- **Add New Todos**: Users can add a task by specifying a title and description.
- **Edit Todos**: Users can modify the title and description of an existing task.
- **Complete Todos**: Tasks can be marked as completed and will be moved to the "Completed" section.
- **Delete Todos**: Users can delete both active and completed tasks.
- **Data Persistence**: Todos and completed tasks are stored in **localStorage**, ensuring persistence even after refreshing the page.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Memory Map / Storage Structure

The **localStorage** is used to store two arrays:

| Key            | Purpose                   |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| `todolist`     | Stores active (incomplete) tasks. |
| `completedTodos` | Stores completed tasks, along with the timestamp of when they were completed. |
